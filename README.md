# ProjectTF

The more important aspect of Machine learning algorithms is the evaluation of each of them and comparing it with all the similar algorithms.

The Stacked autoencoder here will be evaluated with some scores like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Score and at last create a confision matrix which will visualize all the results and confirm different score.

Other models will be updated soon.
